# 65C02 CPU emulator written in Go

Writing this just for fun and to clear out some of the cob-webs.

Intended to support the full 65C02 instruction set and provide an interface allowing the implementation of a "bus emulator" for memory and device I/O, allowing external implementation of ROM/RAM and peripherals e.g. UART.
